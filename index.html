          <div class="resume-item pb-0">
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>My project is to build a mobile application to construction sites. Normally in the construction sites
              manually ordering their building materials like cement, metals, bricks and other needs with the tide
              schedule. It is a time wasting work to collect their building materials manually. Sometimes suppliers
              missing the ordered materials and it cause to extra cost to transport them in several times. But if you
              are ordering them in online stores will get the order real time. If item is not available in this time
              supplier can reject or fulfill the product which are ordered. Not only are that audit process of the goods
              very easy to maintain with that application.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="resume-item pb-0">
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <p>According to buildsoft.com.au there are over 360000 businesses related to Construction Company and
              thousands of employees who provide services to construction industry. If we are creating this type of
              application it will help to millions of employees who works in construction fields. Not only that this
              application runs on mobile phones, thatâ€™s why mobility of this application and easy to use this in
              construction sites. Otherwise it will not easy to maintain the laptop or desktop in working construction
              sites.
              Not only that supervisors can check availability of the item in their store and send his order to store
              keeper or place a order to the other store through this application. It is another advantage of this
              application for Construction Company.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="resume-item pb-0">
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>In this mobile application user first create an administration user accounts to the company. Then create
              an organization to the construction company. Organization should contain name, address, business
              registration, employee details, supplier details and other details valuable to the organization.
              Administrator can add user levels and user to the application. For example if supervisor accounts can show
              existing stock of the items in the site. If new stock arrived to the site supervisor can update the
              existing item and add new item to site inventory. And supervisor can place item order to the main store.
              If store keeper check the order and confirm the order and place it in to process. If item not available in
              the main store, store keeper keeps the record of the missing item and get download the missing item list
              and buy it from a hardware shop.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this application has two types of store one is site store and other is main store.
              Application has different locations, each location has unique id, name, address, telephone number,
              location manager, other location unique details. Each location has their own store. This application has
              item list. Administrator can add items to the item list not only that it can edit and delete the items
              from the item list. Each store can add items to their store as quantities as they wish. Each location can
              create order by location supervisor. It is in open status, if store keeper accept the order it has become
              pending order if he close it, it become closed oreder.location supplier can close the order if order is
              completed status become done.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each user can edit their user accounts such as name, user name, profile picture, telephone number
              positions etc. administrator can active and inactive each user accounts.
              This application also maintain the tracks of logs of each user steps with time and description. It will
              help to audit the each and every users works with the application. Not only that it tracks the feedback
              system to get the user experience with main store.
            </p>

          <div class="resume-item pb-0">
            <h4>Tools and technologies</h4>
            <p>This application based on mobile application. Each supervisor can place app on their android or apple
              phone but main store cannot manage with that kind of small screen. Because of main store need tablet to
              maintain this application. For the easy of use it has also web application to access same database. Main
              store need a printer to get printed copy for transport. Mobile application build on area native for
              deployment on apple and android users. Otherwise need to develop two application for apple and android. I
              will use my sql as the database for this application with laravel backend. I will develop web frontend
              with react.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="resume-item pb-0">
            <h4>Skills required</h4>
            <p>For this application will developing based on react native. For react native development I need visual
              studio code as the code editor. React native can deploy both android and IOS devices. For android version
              we need android mobile phone and android studio for deployment of android. For IOS deployment we need mac
              book with xcode and apple iPhone. API is not based on OS I will use MySQL for database in XAMPP server and
              laravel framework for create API endpoint. Visual studio code is used as code editor and phpMyadmin use to
              access MySQL database in graphically way. React is using for create frontend of portal application.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="resume-item pb-0">
            <h4>Outcome</h4>
            <p>This project based on requirement of construction field. After implement my solution site supervisor can
              make order online and check availability on time. Also he can check on site store without physically check
              it. It will save the supervisor time and effort. Construction site will be full managed and organized
              through the system. Main store also the same, store keeper can take order in online. He can avoid some
              paper works from the system and save the time and money. And also he can check the status of the order
              placed by the supervisor. Supervisor also same, he or she can check his or her order status and can take
              decision easily.</p>
